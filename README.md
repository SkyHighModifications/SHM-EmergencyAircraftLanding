# Configuration

We include a very simple configuration file that allows you to get going with your script within minutes, and you are good to go!

# Features
### Here are the top main features within Emergency-Aircraft-Landing

### Emergency Landing Detection
 - Checks the altitude of the vehicle to determine if it's above a specified threshold.
 - The script detects if the player is in any plane or helicopter.
  
### Automatic / Manual NPC Escort Plane Deployment
 - The escort plane follows the player's aircraft at a fixed distance.
 - Players can manually trigger the escort plane by using a specified command  `(emland)`.
 - If the conditions for an emergency landing are met, an escort plane is automatically spawned.
  
### Dynamic Altitude-Based Tasks
 - Different tasks are assigned to the escort plane based on the altitude of the player's aircraft.
  
### Notification / Blip System
 - Notifies other players about the emergency landing, including the player's name, vehicle type, and location.
 - Marks the location of the emergency landing on the map with a custom blip, distinguishing between planes, helicopters, and general crash locations.
  
### Runway Detection
 - Determines the nearest runway based on predefined locations, enhancing the accuracy of the emergency landing notifications.
  
### Configurability
 - Allows customization of blip colors, scales, and notification messages.
